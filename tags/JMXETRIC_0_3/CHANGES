Changes in version 0.3

Please note that the config file format has changed to support mbeans with a dot in the name. See the README or example file.

* Built using Maven
* #2 Compiled to target JVM 1.5 for legacy support
* #3 NPE if <mbean> element has no "pname" attribute specified 
* #4 Attributes with embedded "."s improperly parsed 
* #5 Uninitialised mbeans cause exception on startup 
* #7 Incorrect javaagent option sample in README 
* #7 Slope is not defined in the config file so cannot use ganglia/rrd counter attributes 
* Suppress exception (keep warning) in the event the mbean is slow to initialise on startup

Changes in version 0.2

* Added support for the ganglia 3.1.* wire format. 
* Added support for UDP unicast. 

Thanks to Sam Tunnicliffe and Malcolm Landon for the patch.
